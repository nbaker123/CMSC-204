This project was much easier than expected since there really wasn't much to program.
I did enjoy it, however, and for a few reasons.

The first reason was that it helped me get used to hashing (or at least bucket hashing),
and the second reason was that it made me apply my knowledge of comparators, thus refreshing
me on how to make and use them.

One thing I did not like about the project, however, was making my own test since I had to
make one which tested all of the data for courses.txt, which took a boring while to write and debug.

But hey, that's programming. The rest was easy for me anyways, so I don't really care about that
in the end.
