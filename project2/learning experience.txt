This project, although easy on paper, took longer than expected, although not to long to complete.
In fact, it was actually pretty fun since it taught me a lot about handling objects, and helped me
refine my abilities with generics and exception handling.

This was also the first project where I used the debugger effectively, and that is certainly
something I will do on future projects. This project also showed me that creating/implementing
data structures may not be the worst thing in the world from whwat I've seen and experienced both
in the past and right now.

Overall, this project was a nice workout, and although I didn't struggle very much with it, it still
taught me a lot as a programmer.
