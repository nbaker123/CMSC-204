The assignment description for BasicDoubleLinkedList said that I had to make the tail point to the head, so I decided to make a
circly/looping linked list by structure.

WAIT WAIT!!! The list still functions as a doubly linked list, however, so don't worry about it having other functions. I was just doing
what the description told me to do.

Thanks.
