This project was the most arduous I have ever done, and for one reason only: DIJKSTRA'S
ALGORITHM! That algorithm took me over five hours to figure out how to do with what I had,
and almost as long to actually code it. However, the debug process did not take that long.

This project not only allowed me to experience implementing other people's algorithms for
the first time, but it also gave me a lot of practice with using iterators and hash sets.

In addition to this, I also got more practice on creating my own JUnit tests. Specifically, with
creating and testing my own data.

I don't seem to know what I would do differently if I did this project again, but this was
certainly a learning experience.
